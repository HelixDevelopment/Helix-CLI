# Phase 5 Test Plan - Complete Test Coverage

## Overview
This test plan ensures 100% coverage of all Phase 5 features including distributed worker network, advanced LLM tooling, MCP integration, notification system, and cross-platform support.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- Individual component testing
- Mock dependencies
- Edge cases and error conditions
- 100% code coverage target

### 2. Integration Tests
- Component interaction testing
- Database integration
- External service integration
- Multi-component workflows

### 3. Automation Tests
- Automated test execution
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Performance and load testing
- Security testing

### 4. End-to-End Tests
- Complete user workflows
- Real AI integration testing
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Production-like environments

## Test Infrastructure

### Required Dependencies
- Docker containers for isolated testing
- SSH worker nodes (local VMs or containers)
- Real LLM providers (OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)
- Notification channels (Slack, Discord, Email)
- MCP servers for protocol testing
- Mobile emulators (iOS/Android)

### Test Environment Setup
1. **Docker Compose** for service orchestration
2. **Test SSH keys** for worker authentication
3. **Mock services** for external dependencies
4. **Database fixtures** for consistent test data
5. **Performance monitoring** for load testing

## Test Execution Strategy

### Local Development
- Fast unit and integration tests
- Mock external dependencies
- Developer-friendly feedback

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Full test suite execution
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scanning
- Code coverage reporting

### Production Staging
- Real-world environment testing
- Load and stress testing
- Disaster recovery testing
- Security penetration testing

## Success Criteria
- 100% test coverage for all components
- All tests pass in all environments
- Performance targets met (<500ms response time)
- Security vulnerabilities addressed
- Cross-platform compatibility verified
