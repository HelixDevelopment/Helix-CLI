# Helix CLI Specification v3.0 - Complete Technical Blueprint

## 1. Project Foundation & Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Mission Statement
Helix CLI is an AI-powered coding agent designed specifically for terminal environments that enables developers to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) for comprehensive software development workflows. The system bridges the gap between AI capabilities and traditional development practices through a unified, terminal-first interface.

### 1.2 Design Principles
- **Terminal-First Philosophy**: All features must work seamlessly in terminal environments
- **AI-Augmented Development**: LLMs enhance but don't replace developer decision-making
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features scale from basic to advanced based on hardware capabilities
- **Zero Configuration Defaults**: Sensible defaults that work out of the box
- **Composable Architecture**: Independent components that can be used separately or together

### 1.3 Technical Foundation
- **Language**: Go (Golang) for all core components
- **Architecture**: Microservices with bash orchestration
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL with SQLCipher encryption
- **Configuration**: JSON-based with environment variable overrides
- **Cross-Platform**: Native support for Linux, macOS, BSDs, Windows
