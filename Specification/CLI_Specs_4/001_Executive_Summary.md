# Helix CLI Specification v4.0 - Implementation-Ready Technical Blueprint

## Executive Implementation Analysis

Based on comprehensive analysis of reference implementations (OpenCode, Charm Crush, Ollama Code, Codename Goose, Gemini Code, Qwen Code), this specification provides exact implementation details with proven architectural patterns.

### Key Implementation Insights from Reference Projects:
- **OpenCode**: Clean Go architecture with panic recovery and structured logging
- **Codename Goose**: Rust-based with MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration and comprehensive tool ecosystem
- **Ollama Code**: TypeScript-based with sophisticated tool discovery and execution systems
- **Qwen Code**: Advanced provider abstraction with streaming and compression capabilities

### Critical Success Factors Identified:
1. **Modular Tool Systems**: Reference projects demonstrate that successful AI coding assistants implement modular tool architectures with standardized interfaces
2. **Provider-Agnostic Interfaces**: All analyzed projects use abstraction layers to support multiple LLM providers seamlessly
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and graceful degradation are essential for production systems
4. **Streaming Support**: Real-time response streaming significantly improves user experience
5. **Hardware Optimization**: Automatic hardware detection and model optimization are critical for performance
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% test coverage with multiple test types ensures reliability
7. **Security Architecture**: End-to-end encryption and access control are mandatory for enterprise use

### Implementation Philosophy:
- **Terminal-First Design**: All features must work seamlessly in terminal environments
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features scale from basic to advanced based on hardware capabilities
- **Zero Configuration Defaults**: Sensible defaults that work out of the box
- **Composable Architecture**: Independent components that can be used separately or together
- **Extensibility First**: Plugin system for unlimited customization and integration

### Technical Foundation Requirements:
- **Language**: Go (Golang) for all core components
- **Architecture**: Microservices with bash orchestration
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL with SQLCipher encryption
- **Configuration**: JSON-based with environment variable overrides
- **Cross-Platform**: Native support for Linux, macOS, BSDs, Windows
